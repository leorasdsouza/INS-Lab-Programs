# Information & Network Security Lab Programs

This repository contains implementations of various cryptographic algorithms and security concepts as part of the **Information & Network Security Lab**. Each folder contains a specific program with its own README, explanation, and code.

## Repository Structure
Each folder contains an individual lab program along with its README for explanations and instructions.

| Program | Description |
|---------|------------|
| [Caesar Cipher](./CaesarCipher/) | Implements the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption. |
| [Hill Cipher](./HillCipher/) | Implementation of Hill Cipher encryption and decryption. |
| [Playfair Cipher](./PlayfairCipher/) | Encrypts and decrypts text using the Playfair Cipher technique. |
| [Feistel Cipher](./FeistelCipher/) | Demonstrates the Feistel structure, a fundamental block cipher design used in cryptography. |
| [Monoalphabetic Cipher](./MonoalphabeticCipherr/) | Implements a substitution cipher where each letter is mapped to another. |
| [Vigenère Cipher](./VigenèreCipher/) | Implements the Vigenère Cipher, a polyalphabetic substitution encryption method. |
| [DES Algorithm](./DESAlgorithm/) | Implements the Data Encryption Standard (DES) for secure communication. |
